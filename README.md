# React FrontEnd Template
This is a barebones React frontend-only template that is intended for use on something like Cloudflare Workers or some other serverless infrastructure.

## Why not use <insert 1 of 50,000+ templates here>?
Beats me! Use whatever you want. This template is being built for learning purposes and my continued ease of development in the future.  

# What's included?
This template is intended to offer ease of use and try to retain readability as much as possible.
The following libraries are in use:
- React (obviously)
- webpack
- eslint
- prettier
- TypeScript
- Selenium + Cypress (work in progress/learning)
- postcss
- tailwindcss
- handlebars
- husky
- jest

# Webpack Configuration (WIP) ðŸš§
Only the development config is available at this time.

Future plans:
- Tree shaking; minimizing excess code wherever possible.
- Code splitting
- Module Federation

# Configuration
## .env (WIP) ðŸš§
Unknown at this time; planned:
- Easy Module Federation configuration

# What else?
I have no idea. Feel free to open a discussion, or outright submit PRs.
